# Eth vs Fab - A Deep dive Comparison - Part 1

> **Caveat Emptor** - If you are looking for a non-technical comparison, this article is not for you. But if you are a ninja ‚öîÔ∏è developer or a fledgeling üê¶ one, this is the right place to understand the internals of the platforms side-by-side.  

In this article, we deconstruct some of the similarities and differences between two of the most popular Blockchain Platforms - Hyperledger Fabric v2 and Ethereum v1 (as of 10th Oct 2020). The motive is simple. We have much material explaining the workings of each of these ledger platforms. However, there still does not exist a deep-dive comparison of these ledger platforms. üßê

Most comparisons that I have stumbled is either a tabular one discussing the core features of the platforms like Consensus, Permissioning, smart contract language, and the likes. Personally, as a technology geek and a person who likes to dive deep and ask a lot of questions, these articles do not quench my thirst. üòÖüç∫

So, as an Architect, I decided to make an attempt to understand these platforms deep and explores the fundamentals that make these Platforms the most acclaimed ones. 

This will be a six-part series of articles where I will attempt to take each of the fundamental concepts of a Blockchain Platform and attempt to expound them as it is architected in each of the platforms with the rationale behind it. I will also try to provide an essence of the key architectural considerations made while designing the platforms. 

I will try to explore the following areas, and in each, I try to cover three fundamental aspects. First is the need, second is key architectural considerations and finally the comparison. My goal is to be objective and non-partisan. For this, I will share the references to the sources from where I have obtained and compiled the information. 

## Comparison Areas

| Area | Covered In |
|------|------------|
|Overall Architecture|Part 1|
|Block Architecture|Part 2|
|Ledger & Storage|Part 2|
|Identity Management|Part 3|
|Transaction Lifecycle|Part 4|
|Smart Contracts & Ledger State|Part 4|
|Consensus Process|Part 5|
|Security|Part 6|
|Confidentiality|Part 6|

# Overall Architecture of Hyperledger Fabric vs Ethereum

In this section I attempt to break down the fundamental cogs that drive the Fabric Blockchain Operating system from the Ethereum Blockchain Operating system. Although mouthful it may sound, both of these platforms are irrefutably distributed in nature. Hence all principles of distributed systems apply here. If you are not too familiar with distributed system principles I cannot recommend [this](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/single-page.html) article enough for a quick reckoner on Distributed systems. 

But let me take a quick plunge into the **fundamentals of distributed systems**:

- Distributed systems are composed of nodes or computers that are capable of computing (calculating), storing, and transmitting data.
- These computers are *Unreliable* and so are the *communication channel(s)* that connect them. Any or both can crash or malfunction at any point of time. 
- Distributed systems do not have a global clock. Ever tried setting two electronic clocks precisely to the second (do it with two computers to the millisecond).
- Distributed systems are hard. One simply does not design a distributed system if there was a monolith computer with infinite compute and storage.
- All systems are eventually designed to cater to Functional and Non-Functional needs. Non-Functional needs a.k.a. Quality Needs. Basic quality needs of any distributed system include Scalability, Performance, Availability, and Fault Tolerance.
- For reliability and availability one needs to replicate data. Where there is replication involved in distributed systems, the famous CAP theorem applies. It says that you cannot have all three properties in a distributed system (which replicates data) at the same time, i.e. Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance. Try achieving any two and you have to trade-off the other.  

Although all of these are important but perhaps I feel the most important of these is
