Experience
---------
**BOSCH, India** (2018-present, Bangalore, IN)

- **Decentralized Supply chain Platform**
<br>
Responsible for architecting and designing  
    - Support for Enterprise DLT platforms like Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Besu, Quorum.
    - Microservices and relevant patterns viz. Circuit Breaker, Service Mesh, Event Driven Approach, Sagas for Performance, Fault Tolerance, Observability, and Eventual Data Consistency
    - Support for cloud native technologies and loose coupling with managed services, databases, and ledger platforms.
    - Fine grained control over privacy needs for the application while ensuring integrity of data using a combination of P2P communication and cryptographic means.
- Co Innovation Projects with Customers. Responsible for architecting and designing:
    - Contention resolution of railway resource usage with autonomous auctioning, allocation and settlement of railway resources in real-time. Used Autonomous Agent Framework, Single Board Computer (RPi3), Ethereum Blockchain for developing Autonomous Auctioning Solution.
    - Enable autonomous energy savings in households. IoT enabled HVAC devices were made to participate in a energy saving drive using reverse-economics to optimize energy savings and incentive payouts while meeting total budget of incentive tokens. Used Autonomous Agent Framework, BOSCH Smart Power Devices, BOSCH IoT suite, Ethereum Blockchain for developing Reverse Auction Mechanism. Enhanced the privacy further using MPC techniques like Homomorphic Encryption for Blind Auctions.
    - Enabling cross border tax settlement using DLT for the automotive industry.
    - Provenance of dairy products, by enabling livestock tracking as Non Fungible Tokens and capturing health and life events blockchain. This facilitates certication of organic and hygienic dairy products
